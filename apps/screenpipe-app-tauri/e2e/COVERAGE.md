# E2E Coverage Map

This is a behavioral coverage dashboard for the Tauri/WebDriver E2E suite.
It is not line or branch coverage. A spec contributes coverage to each platform
and layer declared in the manifest, weighted by confidence and criticality.

- Manifest: `e2e/coverage-map.json`
- Specs directory: `e2e/specs`
- Mapped specs: 89
- Declared test blocks: 251
- Weighted coverage points: 193.7

Confidence weights: strong=1.0, partial=0.7, conditional=0.4, smoke=0.3.
Criticality weights: high=1.0, medium=0.7, low=0.4.
Declared test blocks are counted statically from source, so parameterized specs
can execute more runtime cases than this number shows.

## Platform Summary

| Platform | Specs | Declared tests | Weighted points | Layers | Features | Critical score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| windows | 72 | 224 | 181.2 | 15 | 77 | 91% |
| macos | 85 | 214 | 164.5 | 17 | 79 | 89% |
| linux | 62 | 184 | 151.0 | 14 | 72 | 88% |

## Runtime Results

No runtime result directory was supplied. Run with
`--results-dir e2e/results` after WDIO emits runtime JSON to include actual
pass/fail/skip counts.

## Critical Gaps

- windows: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Meetings-only audio device ownership (weak); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).
- macos: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Audio device health (weak); Meetings-only audio device ownership (weak); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).
- linux: Real capture, OCR, and indexing (weak); Audio device health (gap); Updater install and rollback safety (gap).

## Execution Integrity

- Specs that claim coverage but contain zero executable test blocks: zzz-browser-state-chat-switch.spec.ts, zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts, zzz-owned-browser-headless.spec.ts. They assert nothing and no longer count toward any critical feature.
- Declared coverage below is NOT reconciled against execution: no runtime results
  were supplied. Specs can self-skip on hosted runners (no display, vision off,
  recording disabled) and still read as covered. Run `e2e:coverage:runtime` (or pass
  `--results-dir`) in CI to flag declared coverage that did not actually run.

## Spec Inventory

| Spec | Platforms | Layers | Features | Criticality | Confidence | UX | Tests | Notes |

| brain-overview.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, local-api, pipes | brain, brain-overview, brain-canvas, artifacts, pipes | high | strong | real-user-flow | 3 | Creates the first-open starter dashboard, renders source-backed selectable and fixed-period Live Views, verifies dashboard switching stays available during refresh, omits fixed-period controls from view and Customize, exercises durable Canvas notes, connections, keyboard movement, navigation restore, deletion cleanup, and checks layout bounds from 800x600 through 1920x1080. |
| brain-section.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e | brain, artifacts, memories, viewer-deeplink | medium | strong | real-user-flow | 10 | Brain coverage for filters, search, delete flows, selection pruning, add memory, and inline artifact markdown preview. |

| chat-connections-context-duplicate.spec.ts | windows, macos | chat-ai | chat, chat-sidebar-dedupe | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | QUARANTINED (#4689): connections-context wrapper stripping regression. The synthetic background-router event path never persists deterministically on Linux/macOS CI; re-enable once it drives a deterministic persisted session. |
| chat-cost-limit-upgrade.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e, tauri-command | chat | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | A local provider returns the gateway's structured daily-cost rejection for a Basic account; the request crosses the real Pi and foreground-event path, then the UI shows account-budget copy and a Business action without depending on the separate query counter. |
| chat-cross-window-transcript-sync.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, window-lifecycle, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-streaming, window-lifecycle | high | strong | mixed | 1 | Both Home and standalone Chat show persistent pending feedback, then hydrate a completed disk transcript and clear stop state from the real cross-window save event without calling a provider. |
| chat-empty-space.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat | medium | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | A real Tauri chat session keeps a short answer at the top of the message rail without exposing a false new-content state. |
| chat-hosted-retry-feedback.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e, tauri-command | chat, chat-streaming | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | A local provider returns priced_request_in_flight twice; Pi retries while the UI remains active, a real composer follow-up enters the Rust queue, and both turns recover without the misleading mid-response error. |
| chat-new-session-stale-save.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e, storage-privacy | chat, chat-drafts | high | strong | synthetic | 1 | Switching to a new Pi session binds its echoed user turn to the new conversation file and leaves the previous chat intact. |

| chat-newchat-fresh.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-drafts | medium | partial | real-user-flow | 2 | The real new-chat shortcut opens a fresh chat from non-empty conversations and reuses one blank chat when pressed repeatedly. |
| chat-parallel-jobs-duplicate.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai | chat, chat-sidebar-dedupe | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | Parallel auto-send prefill dedupe regression. |
| chat-prefill-context-leak.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai | chat, chat-prefill | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | Pending auto-send prefill must render only the clean prompt, not the internal model context, as the user message. |
| chat-prefill-duplicate.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai | chat, chat-prefill | medium | partial | synthetic | 1 | QUARANTINED (#4610): cross-window prefill duplicate regression. The autoSend persist precondition is racy in CI — times out with 0 conversations (not the duplicate=2 it guards) ~100% Linux + ~33% macOS. Re-enable once it seeds the persisted conversation deterministically. |
| chat-queue-burst-pending.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai | chat | high | conditional | synthetic | 1 | Several messages queued during an active turn must all become pending cards immediately; regression for the conversation-lease hold that serialized enqueues one per turn. |
| chat-settings-background-stream.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, settings, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-streaming, settings | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Opening the standalone Settings route mid-stream must not abort the chat: a long synthetic stream keeps running while the user round-trips to Settings, remains live in Recents, and restores the full response (early + final tokens) after the row is clicked. |
| chat-sidebar-groups.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-sidebar-groups | medium | strong | real-user-flow | 9 | Pipe auto-grouping (collapse, badge, expand/collapse, localStorage persistence) and manual sidebar groups (move-to-group, section headers, remove-from-group cleanup). 8 tests. |
| chat-sidebar-pipe-inventory.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, pipes, real-ui-e2e | chat, pipes, chat-sidebar-groups | high | strong | mixed | 1 | A collapsed Pipes section loads nothing; expanding it lists a compact execution-backed activity page, expanding a pipe lazily loads its newest 10 executions, and older runs paginate on demand. |
| chat-sidebar-repeated-prompt.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-sidebar-dedupe | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Two distinct chats sent with the same opening prompt stay visible in the left sidebar. |

| chat-stop-midturn.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai | chat | high | conditional | synthetic | 2 | Stop on a live turn against a real Pi subprocess: abort mid-stream then send again (no ghost turn or hang), and two overlapping Stops followed by a clean send. Queue lifecycle regression for the request-id correlation refactor. |
| chat-streaming-performance.spec.ts | macos | chat-ai, performance | chat, chat-streaming | medium | conditional | performance | 2 | macOS-only chat streaming responsiveness. |
| chat-subagent-async-completion.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e, tauri-command | chat | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Verifies an asynchronous subagent completion appears as a second assistant turn after the original answer settles. |

| chat-tool-activity.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | chat, chat-tools, pi-tool-activity, progressive-disclosure | high | strong | mixed | 4 | Mixed Python, JavaScript, Screenpipe API, file, test, recovered-error, and optional live Pi tool flows stay collapsed by default, expose only friendly activity on first expansion, keep completed tools active while the shared Pi turn is still streaming, and capture screenshots. |
| chat-window.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | chat-ai, window-lifecycle, real-ui-e2e | chat, window-lifecycle | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Opens Chat and focuses the composer for typing. |

| db-hard-fault-fail-closed.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | local-api, tauri-command, real-ui-e2e | database-hard-fault-containment, app-launch | high | strong | mixed | 1 | Opt-in packaged-desktop regression: causes real SQLITE_CORRUPT in the isolated E2E database, then proves the engine API and database owners stop while the desktop stays alive and does not respawn across the watchdog window. |
| first-run-guide.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | onboarding, chat-ai, real-ui-e2e | onboarding, chat, first-run-guide | high | strong | real-user-flow | 3 | Replayed first-run guide verifies the composer remains focused and clickable above its scrim, fails open when stacking defeats the lift, and remembers decline across reloads. |

| timeline.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, capture-ocr | timeline, capture-ocr | high | conditional | real-user-flow | 3 | Timeline shell always runs; seeded frame assertion skips under no-recording. |
| tray-recording-status.spec.ts | windows | os-integration, tauri-command | tray-recording-status | high | strong | command | 1 | Drives Starting to Recording and reads back the status item from the successfully installed native tray menu. |
| tray-search.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | window-lifecycle, tauri-command, real-ui-e2e | tray-search, home-search, window-lifecycle | high | partial | command | 2 | Invokes open_search_window and verifies focused floating Search. |
| updater-banner.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings | update-surfacing, settings-persistence | high | partial | mixed | 2 | Synthetic update-available event surfaces the restart-to-update banner. A real Auto-update toggle plus delayed store save verifies restart waits for preference persistence and survives settings-store re-hydration; an E2E-only handoff suppresses the destructive relaunch. Real check/download/install + rollback stay manual via e2e/mock-updates because the debug E2E build disables updater checks. |
| viewer-deeplink.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | window-lifecycle, tauri-command | viewer-deeplink, window-lifecycle | medium | partial | command | 3 | Viewer window creation and per-path dedupe. |
| window-activation.spec.ts | macos | window-lifecycle, tauri-command, real-ui-e2e | window-lifecycle, chat | medium | conditional | real-user-flow | 2 | macOS-only show_window_activated focus coverage. |
| window-lifecycle.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | window-lifecycle, tauri-command, real-ui-e2e | window-lifecycle, onboarding, tray-search | high | strong | mixed | 3 | Home, Search, and onboarding window routing. |
| windows-core-recording.spec.ts | windows | capture-ocr, local-api, audio-device, notifications, storage-privacy, real-ui-e2e | capture-ocr, local-api-auth, local-api-search, audio-device-health, timeline, low-disk-recording-guard | high | conditional | mixed | 13 | Windows recording-enabled lane; low-disk coverage requires teardown of a real CaptureSession and continued API/search availability, while hosted runners can skip only frame-dependent OCR assertions. |
| windows-system-integration.spec.ts | windows | os-integration, local-api, audio-device, window-lifecycle, performance | app-launch, local-api-auth, audio-device-health, window-lifecycle, os-process-health, webview-stability | high | strong | mixed | 15 | Windows display, WebView2, loopback, process, Defender, audio, focus, and crash-report checks. |
| windows-user-journey.spec.ts | windows | real-ui-e2e, settings, notifications, storage-privacy, window-lifecycle | home-search, timeline, settings-recording, meeting-notes, shortcut-reminder, notifications, storage-retention, settings-privacy-api-auth | high | strong | real-user-flow | 8 | Windows-first real UX journey across search, timeline, settings, meetings, notifications, storage, and privacy. |
| zz-account-basic-upgrade-billing.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings, billing | account-upgrade, billing-proration, checkout-duplication | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Basic paid user clicking Account upgrade opens account billing for subscription changes/proration and does not call the fresh subscription checkout endpoint. |
| zz-account-stale-subscription.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings, billing | account-card, billing-gate | medium | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | Account 'active' plan card is gated on the session token (token AND cloud_subscribed) like the header, so a tokenless-but-subscribed stale shell (post-#3943 secret-store token desync) renders 'not logged in' with the active card gone. Mocks /api/user across all windows and clears set_cloud_token to reproduce the desync deterministically. |
| zz-app-entitlement-gate.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | settings, billing, real-ui-e2e | app-entitlement-gate, billing-gate | high | strong | real-user-flow | 2 | Production billing gate blocks an unentitled session behind the paywall and restores access when the forced-gate flag is cleared. |
| zz-audio-fallback-reverify.spec.ts | macos | auth, entitlement, audio-device, settings | cloud-entitlement-reverify, audio-engine-fallback, settings-recording | high | strong | real-user-flow | 1 | AuthGuard re-verifies cloud entitlement on window focus so a freshly-subscribed user gets cloud transcription without restart (#4339). |
| zz-enterprise-license-prompt.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | settings, billing, real-ui-e2e | app-entitlement-gate, billing-gate | high | strong | real-user-flow | 2 | Enterprise license prompt handles invalid keys, full-seat errors, and retry success after seats are added without staying stuck in validating state. |
| zz-logout-resurrect.spec.ts | windows, macos, linux | real-ui-e2e, settings | account-logout, auth-session | high | strong | synthetic | 1 | Logout must not be resurrected by an in-flight loadUser. Logs in via a synthetic deep-link (?api_key=) with a mocked /api/user fetch, makes the fetch slow, fires it, then clicks logout while it is pending and asserts the slow response cannot re-write the user (the 'logout needs two clicks' bug). Covers the auth-generation guard in use-settings.tsx. |
| zz-owned-browser-background-nav.spec.ts | windows, macos | os-integration, window-lifecycle | owned-browser, window-lifecycle | low | smoke | command | 0 | Owned browser background navigation visibility. |
| zzz-browser-state-chat-switch.spec.ts | windows, macos | real-ui-e2e, storage-privacy | chat, owned-browser | high | strong | synthetic | 0 | Synthetic E2E (zzz- prefix, search-driven): starts from a fresh chat with no conversation file, seeds browser state before the first durable save, then verifies auto-save persists that state and it survives a switch away and back. Keeps native visibility assertions out of this spec because post-zz window state is too brittle; deeper save/merge coverage lives in focused tests. |
| zzz-owned-browser-headless.spec.ts | windows, macos | os-integration, window-lifecycle, local-api | owned-browser, window-lifecycle | high | strong | mixed | 0 | Headless owned browser for background pipes (#4248): with the sidebar never opened, a background eval and navigate-and-scrape over the local API lazily create a hidden offscreen child webview, return a real JS result (6*7 -> 42; document.readyState), and stay invisible; is_ready reflects real serviceability; the same singleton is then adopted into the sidebar panel (page state survives, no second webview). Search-driven and runs last because attaching the child to home tears down home's WebDriver handle. |
